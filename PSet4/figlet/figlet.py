"""
implement a program that:

    Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
        Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
        Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, 
            in which case the first of the two should be -f or --font, 
            and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
    Prompts the user for a str of text.
    Outputs that text in the desired font.

If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f 
or --font or the second is not the name of a font, the program should exit 
via sys.exit with an error message.
